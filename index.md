### Introduction

Hello, my name is Owen Langejans. I’m currently a high school student planning to pursue a degree in Mathematics. I spend my time learning and practicing running (not running code but actual running), playing chess, table tennis, and working at Forensic Fluids Laboratories for database developement. I enjoy coding and am new to web development.

### Current Projects

I am in the middle of learning how to do multi-dimensional dynamic programming. Currently, I am doing research under Dr. Ajay Gupta of WMU studying “Analyzing the risks of heart disease using machine learning techniques.” I also have many projects through Forensic Fluids, including exporting reports from an old server and large reports.

### Future Plans

I plan on studying Actuarial Science with a math major and a possible computer science major, and business minor at either the University of Michigan or Drake University.

### Skills

C#, C++, Java, PostgreSQL, TransactSQL, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), SQL Server Management Studios (SSMS), Oracle-SQL Developer, Tensor Flow.
