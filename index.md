### Introduction

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/owenlangejans/owenlan.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Hello, my name is Owen Langejans. I’m currently a high school student planning to pursue a degree in Mathematics. I spend my time learning and practicing running (not running code but actual running), playing chess, table tennis, and working at Forensic Fluids Laboratories for database developement. I enjoy coding and am new to web development.

### Current Projects
I am in the middle of learning how to do multi-dimensional dynamic programming. Currently, I am doing research under Dr. Ajay Gupta of WMU studying “Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning Techniques.” I also have many projects through Forensic Fluids, including exporting reports from an old server and large reports

### Future Plans
I plan on studying Actuarial Science with a math major and a possible computer science major at either the University of Michigan or Drake University.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/owenlangejans/owenlan.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
